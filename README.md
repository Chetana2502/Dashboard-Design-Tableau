# Dashboard Design Tableau

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my internship tasks.  
The goal was to design an **interactive Tableau dashboard** for business stakeholders using a sales dataset (Superstore / Kaggle Sales_Financial data).  

The dashboard provides insights into **Sales performance, Orders, Growth, Categories, Geography, and Segments**, and is designed with interactivity and storytelling in mind.
